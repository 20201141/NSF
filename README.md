## What is NSF? 
NSF is a forum website that allows users from all around the world to converse with other users about topics related to computer science. The website has features like creating a post, commenting, replying to a comment, liking a comment, and accessing user settings. The key feature that sets NSF apart from other forum websites is the builder page. With NSF, users no longer have to worry about installing multiple different environments and languages to test code! Simply head over to the builder page and upload the file you want to run and compile and you'll be able to see the output instantly!

## Features
### Home
On the home page, users will see the forum that has all of the posts. The users can click on specific posts to see the comments and replies. Each comment has the liking option for users to click to help others see which comment is the most useful. The users can also search for specific posts with keywords. 

### Create Post
The users can create posts by filling out the text boxes for the title and description. The notification bell is a toggle that allows users to receive a notification via email whenever they get a comment on their post. The tags button allows a popup for users to select the appropriate type and tag for the post. At the bottom, there is a built-in builder which the user can use to attach their code to their post for other users to see. 

### Builder
The users can use the builder to run and compile their code as long as it is in a file. They simply select the appropriate options from the dropdown menus and then upload the file with their code. Immediately, the builder will run and compile it based on the selected options. The output is printed beside it upon success. Currently, out website only offers python. In future releases, we plan to add more languages and environments! 

### My Account
The users can access information related to their account on this page. They can change their password as long as they know their current password. Users can also view all of their posts. Users can also personalize the website by changing the theme to dark mode. In future releases, we plan to add more personalization features and the ability to edit posts from the "My Posts" page.
